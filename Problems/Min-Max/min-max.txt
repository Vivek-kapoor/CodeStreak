Given A Series Of N Positive Integers a1,a2,a3........an. , Find The Minimum And Maximum Values That Can Be Calculated By Summing Exactly N-1 Of The N Integers. Then Print The Respective Minimum And Maximum Values As A Single Line Of Two Space-Separated Long Integers.

Input Format

First Line Take Input Value Of N

Second Line Take Input N Space Separated Integer Value

Output Format

Two Space Separated Value ( One Maximum Sum And One Minimum Sum )

Constraints: 


    0 < N < 100001
    0 <= ai < 10^13
