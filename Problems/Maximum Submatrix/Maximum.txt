Given a 2D Grid A[i][j] consisiting of n rows and m columns. 

You need to find a square submatrix of the matrix A such that the sum of its elements is at most x, and its area (the total number of elements) is the largest possible.

Input

The first line contains three integers n and m.

Second line of input contains x maximum possible sum of elements.

Next n lines contain m space separated integers.

Output

Print maximum area of a square submatrix with sum of elements less than equal to x.

Constraints

1 ≤n,m≤ 10^3



1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18



1 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 10^9
